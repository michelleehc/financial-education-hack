      <div style="text-align: center"><h3> Types of Student Loans:</h3></div>
      Student loans come in different forms, each with its own traits and benefits.
      <b> Federal loans</b>, supported by the government, typically offer fixed interest rates and flexible repayment plans.
      <b>Private loans</b>, on the other hand, are provided by banks and private lenders, often with varying interest rates and strict repayment terms.
      <b>Subsidized loans</b>, based on financial need, have their interest covered by the government while you're in school. Unsubsidized loans, not based on need, accumulate interest from the moment you take them out.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      <div style="text-align: center"><h3> Loan Terms and Conditions:</h3></div>
      It's essential to grasp the various terms associated with your loan.
      <b>Interest rates</b> dictate how much you'll pay on top of the loan amount.
      The <b>grace period</b> allows you some time after graduation before repayment begins.
      <b>Repayment options</b> include standard plans, income-driven schemes, and extended repayment plans.
      <b>Eligibility criteria</b> for loans are influenced by factors such as your enrollment status, financial need, and credit history.

      <div style="text-align: center"><h3>Borrowing Limits and Guidelines:</h3></div>
      Understanding your borrowing limits is crucial. These limits are often based on your year in school and whether you're financially independent. Guidelines stress the importance of borrowing only what's necessary to cover your educational expenses. Going beyond these limits can lead to potential financial strains, requiring additional financial planning.
    </p>

      <div style="text-align: center"><h3>Pros and Cons of Student Loans:</h3></div>
      Student loans can be a vital tool for accessing education, building credit, and investing in your future career. However, it's important to recognize that they come with responsibilities. They can accrue interest, potentially leading to a substantial debt burden if not managed responsibly. Carefully considering the long-term implications of taking on student loan debt is essential for a secure financial future.

      <div style="text-align: center"><h3>Importance of Loan Repayment:</h3></div>
      Understanding the significance of timely loan repayment is key. It's not just about paying off a debt; it's also about building a positive credit history that can have far-reaching implications. Failing to manage your loan payments can result in severe consequences, including a damaged credit score and even wage garnishment. Prioritizing responsible loan management is critical to ensure financial stability as you move forward after graduation.
